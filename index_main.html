            HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.

            Disadvantages of Frames
            <br>
            There are few drawbacks with using frames, so it's never recommended to use frames in your webpages âˆ’
            <br>
            Some smaller devices cannot cope with frames often because their screen is not big enough to be divided up.
            <br>
            Sometimes your page will be displayed differently on different computers due to different screen resolution.
            <br>
            The browser's back button might not work as the user hopes.
            <br>
            There are still few browsers that do not support frame technology.

            Creating Frames
            <br>
            To use frames on a page we use <frameset> tag instead of <body> tag. The <frameset> tag defines, how to divide the window into frames. The rows attribute of <frameset> tag defines horizontal frames and cols attribute defines vertical frames. Each frame is indicated by <frame> tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the frame.
